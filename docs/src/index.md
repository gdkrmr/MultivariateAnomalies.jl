## Requirements

- Julia >= `1.0`
- Julia packages `Distances`, `Combinatorics`, `LinearAlgebra`, and `LIBSVM`.

## Installation

- add the package: ```]add MultivariateAnomalies```

## Package Features

- Detect anomalies in your data with easy to use [high level functions](man/HighLevelFunctions.md) or individual [anomaly detection algorithms](man/DetectionAlgorithms.md)

- [Feature Extraction](man/Preprocessing.md): Preprocess your data by extracting relevant features

- [Similarities and Dissimilarities](man/DistancesDensity.md): Compute distance matrices, kernel matrices and k-nearest neighbor objects.

- [Postprocessing](man/Postprocessing.md): Postprocess your anomaly scores, by computing their quantiles or combinations of several algorithms (ensembles).

- [AUC](man/AUC.md): Compute the area under the curve as external evaluation metric of your scores.

- [Online Algorithms](man/OnlineAlgorithms.md): Algorithms tuned for little memory allocation.

## Using the Package

For a quick start it might be useful to start with the [high level functions](man/HighLevelFunctions.md) for detecting anomalies. They can be used in highly automized way. 

## Input Data

*MultivariateAnomalies.jl* assumes that observations/samples/time steps are stored along the first dimension of the data array (rows of a matrix) with the number of observations `T = size(data, 1)`. Variables/attributes are stored along the last dimension `N` of the data array (along the columns of a matrix) with the number of variables `VAR = size(data, N)`. The implemented anomaly detection algorithms return anomaly scores indicating which observation(s) of the data are anomalous.
